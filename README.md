## Overview

**VirSift** is a seven-page Streamlit application for pre-phylogenetic curation and exploration of viral FASTA datasets from human and non-human animal hosts. It supports influenza A, B, C, and D, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), SARS-CoV-2, and other viral datasets whose FASTA headers and metadata are compatible with the parser.

VirSift brings parsing, filtering, deduplication, human-in-the-loop temporal sampling, visualization, molecular persistence analysis, and structured export into one browser-based workflow.

It is designed for virologists, surveillance laboratories, bioinformaticians, epidemiologists, researchers, and instructors who need a reproducible way to prepare viral sequence datasets before alignment, phylogenetic reconstruction, or other downstream analyses.

### Core capabilities

- Parse multiple FASTA and compressed archive formats.
- Interpret supported GISAID-style and NCBI/GenBank-compatible header structures.
- Infer host, normalize species names, extract clade and segment metadata, and calculate MD5 hashes.
- Preserve an immutable pre-filter dataset alongside a mutable curated dataset.
- Apply sequence-quality, metadata, accession, and deduplication filters.
- Run five human-in-the-loop temporal sampling strategies.
- Generate epidemiological, temporal, categorical, and hierarchical visualizations.
- Track molecular clone persistence through a dedicated timeline workflow.
- Export curated data as FASTA, CSV, JSON, session logs, accession lists, and segment-organized ZIP bundles.
- Provide six structurally aligned language catalogues containing 817 keys each.

## Why VirSift?

Preparing viral sequence datasets often involves a mixture of scripts, spreadsheets, manual header editing, and undocumented exclusion decisions. VirSift consolidates those steps into one visual workflow while preserving the distinction between the original parsed dataset and the current curated dataset.

| Capability | Manual spreadsheet workflow | Typical command-line workflow | VirSift |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Browser-based interface | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Multi-format FASTA/archive input | Limited | ✓ | ✓ |
| Viral header interpretation | Manual | Script-dependent | ✓ |
| Immutable pre-filter baseline | Rare | Pipeline-dependent | ✓ |
| Sequence and metadata filtering | Manual | ✓ | ✓ |
| MD5-based deduplication | Rare | ✓ | ✓ |
| Human-in-the-loop temporal sampling | Manual | Limited | ✓ |
| Integrated visual analytics | Limited | Tool-dependent | ✓ |
| Molecular persistence timeline | — | Custom analysis | ✓ |
| Multilingual interface | — | Rare | ✓ |
| Session-aware export and audit trail | Limited | Pipeline-dependent | ✓ |

> VirSift prepares and documents viral sequence datasets for downstream analysis. It does not perform sequence alignment, model selection, or phylogenetic tree inference.

## Supported Viral Workflows

VirSift supports viral FASTA workflows involving viruses collected from both human and non-human animal hosts, including:

- Influenza A, B, C, and D from human, avian, swine, equine, bovine, and other compatible host records
- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from human and animal hosts
- SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses with compatible FASTA headers and metadata
- Other viral datasets whose header structures and metadata are compatible with VirSift Parser 1.0

For compatible records, VirSift can recover available metadata such as host, host species, subtype, segment, clade, accession, collection date, and location. Host information may also be inferred from isolate names when the required information is present.

---

## Architecture

The application separates the immutable dataset produced immediately after parsing from the mutable dataset produced through filtering and sampling. This protects the original baseline while allowing iterative curation of the active working dataset.

</p>

### Logical Workflow

VirSift begins in a pre-activation state. The Home page introduces the platform and directs users to **Workspace** to upload FASTA files. After a selected or merged dataset is activated, the Home page becomes the **Surveillance Observatory**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/virsift-logical-workflow.svg" alt="VirSift logical workflow" width="100%">
</p>

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Home Page<br/>Getting Started<br/>No active dataset] --> B[Workspace / Upload<br/>Upload FASTA files]
    B --> C[Activate selected<br/>or merged dataset]
    C --> D[Home Page becomes<br/>Surveillance Observatory]

    D --> E[Workspace]
    D --> F[Sequence Refinery]
    D --> G[Molecular Timeline]
    D --> H[Analytics]
    D --> I[Export]
    D --> J[Documentation]
```

After activation, users may open **Workspace**, **Sequence Refinery**, **Molecular Timeline**, **Analytics**, **Export**, or **Documentation** in any order. These modules share the currently active dataset but do not form a compulsory linear sequence.

---

## Supported Inputs

VirSift accepts:

```text
.fasta
.fa
.fas
.fna
.txt
.gz
.fasta.gz
.zip
.aln-fasta
```

---

## Quality and Metadata Filtering

VirSift supports:

- Minimum sequence length
- Maximum ambiguous-base or N-run threshold
- Collection-date range
- Host filtering
- Subtype filtering
- Segment filtering
- Location filtering
- Accession-based inclusion or exclusion
- MD5-based exact-sequence deduplication

The **Original (Pre-Filter) Dataset** remains unchanged after parsing. Filters operate on the **Current (Filtered) Dataset**, which can be refined iteratively.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Temporal Sampling

VirSift includes five sampling strategies:

1. **Chronological Sentinel** — selects representative records across time.
2. **Highest Volume Peaks** — prioritizes periods with the largest sequence volume.
3. **Peak Checklist** — lets users confirm candidate sampling peaks.
4. **Custom Checkpoints** — samples user-defined temporal positions.
5. **Visual Lasso** — supports interactive chart-based selection.

---

## Visualization Suite

The visualization layer includes:

- Sunburst charts
- Treemaps
- Gantt timelines
- Sankey flows with up to five levels
- Temporal sequence-record curves
- Host distributions
- Subtype distributions
- Clade distributions
- Other categorical distributions
- Monthly heatmaps

> VirSift charts summarize the sequence records present in the active uploaded dataset. They are not epidemiological case counts, incidence, or prevalence estimates.

---

## Molecular Timeline Tracker

The Molecular Timeline module provides a four-phase workflow for examining molecular clone persistence. Outputs include:

- Diagnostic summaries
- Persistence matrices
- Gantt-style temporal timelines
- Curated sequence and metadata exports

---

## Multilingual Architecture

Each language catalogue contains the same **817 keys**:

- English (`EN`)
- Russian (`RU`)
- French (`FR`)
- Spanish (`ES`)
- Arabic (`AR`)
- Chinese (`ZH`)

English and Russian provide complete native-language coverage. French, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese are structurally complete and retain English source text for values awaiting reviewed native-language completion.

## Data Sources and Interpretation

VirSift supports data obtained from GISAID, NCBI/GenBank, and other sources. Users are responsible for following the access, acknowledgement, privacy, and redistribution terms that apply to their datasets.

For detailed wording, see:

- [`DATA_SOURCES_AND_COMPLIANCE.md`](DATA_SOURCES_AND_COMPLIANCE.md)
- [`DISCLAIMER.md`](DISCLAIMER.md)
- [`docs/APP_FOOTER_DISCLAIMER.md`](docs/APP_FOOTER_DISCLAIMER.md)

---

## Limitations

VirSift:

- Does not perform sequence alignment or phylogenetic tree inference.
- Does not establish biological relatedness from MD5 identity alone.
- Does not convert sequence-record counts into epidemiological case counts.
- Depends on the quality and consistency of uploaded headers and metadata.
- May be constrained by available memory and hosting limits for very large datasets.
- Requires domain-expert interpretation for surveillance or publication use.

---

## Reproducibility

To reproduce a VirSift session, retain:

- The original input dataset
- The exported curated dataset
- The session log
- Applied filter settings
- Sampling-strategy details
- Software version information

---

## Roadmap

Planned development may include:

- Expanded automated test coverage
- Additional viral metadata schemas
- Improved reproducibility snapshots and session restoration
- More export presets and provenance reporting
- Accessibility and right-to-left interface improvements
- Performance profiling for larger datasets
- Additional documentation and teaching datasets
